## General Information

This web page was built for a neighborhood that has decided to create a digital local library where patrons can lend and borrow books. I assisted with this project by building the javascript algorithms that render various statistics on the pages' dashboard. The project goals were:

- Using Visual Studio Code as a text editor
- Practicing writing javascript in a project based enviornment by working with large datasets.
- Building algorithms based on those datasets.
- Differentiating between the three most common JavaScript error types
- Solving bugs by using error messages
  Differentiating between let, const, and var, and using each appropriately
- Accessing all the values and keys of an object
- Using find(), filter(), map(), some(), and every() to solve different problems
- Using reduce() to solve different problems
- Using sort() to sort arrays in various ways
- Using well-named variables, in particular avoiding any single letter variables that lack meaning.
- Making use of both function declarations and arrow functions.
- Building helper functions when appropriate.
- Making use of advanced JavaScript features like ternary operators, the spread operator, object shorthand, array and object destructuring, and for/in loops.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Datasets

There are three datasets that are a part of this project: accounts, authors, and books.

### Accounts

You can view all of the accounts data inside of the public/data/ directory. Each account is an object and an account represents a person who is registered with the library. Accounts can take out and return books.

### Authors

You can view all of the authors data inside of the public/data/ directory. Each author is an object and represents someone who wrote one or more books in the library.

### Books

You can view all of the books data inside of the public/data/ directory. Each book is an object and represents a physical book but also contains additional information. In particular:

- The authorId matches up with an author. It represents who wrote the book.
- The borrows array is a list of transactions that have occurred with this book. For example, the above book has been borrowed three times.
- The id for each "borrow" record matches with an account ID. In the above example, the account with an ID of "5f446f2e2a4fcd687493a775" has not yet returned the book, meaning they still are in possession of it.

## Account Functions

#### findAccountById()

The `findAccountById()` function in `public/src/accounts.js` has two parameters, in the following order:

- An array of accounts.
- An ID of a single account.

It returns the account object that has the matching ID.

**Example:**

```javascript
findAccountById(accounts, "5f446f2ecfaf0310387c9603");
/*
  {
    "id": "5f446f2ecfaf0310387c9603",
    "name": {
      "first": "Esther",
      "last": "Tucker"
    },
    ...
  }
*/
```

#### sortAccountsByLastName()

The `sortAccountsByLastName()` function in `public/src/accounts.js` has a single parameter:

- An array of accounts.

It returns a sorted array of objects. The objects are sorted alphabetically by last name.

**Example:**

```javascript
sortAccountsByLastName(accounts);
/*
  [
    {
      "name": {
        "first": "Kirby",
        "last": "Alston"
      },
      ...
    },
    {
      "name": {
        "first": "Toni",
        "last": "Ball"
      },
      ...
    },
  ]  
*/
```

#### getTotalNumberOfBorrows()

The `getTotalNumberOfBorrows()` function in `public/src/accounts.js` has two parameters, in the following order:

- An account object.
- An array of all books objects.

It returns a _number_ that represents the number of times the account's ID appears in any book's `borrow` array.

**Example:**

```javascript
getTotalNumberOfBorrows(account, books); // 22
```

#### getBooksPossessedByAccount()

The `getBooksPossessedByAccount` function in `public/src/accounts.js` has three parameters, in the following order:

- An account object.
- An array of all books objects.
- An array of all author objects.

It returns an array of books and authors that represents all books _currently checked out_ by the given account. _Look carefully at the object below,_ as it's not just the book object; the author object is embedded inside of it.

**Example:**

```javascript
getBooksPossessedByAccount(account, books, authors);
/*
  [
    {
      id: "5f447132320b4bc16f950076",
      title: "est voluptate nisi",
      genre: "Classics",
      authorId: 12,
      author: {
        id: 12,
        name: {
          first: "Chrystal",
          last: "Lester",
        },
      },
      borrows: [
        {
          id: "5f446f2e6059326d9feb9a68",
          returned: false,
        },
        ...
      ],
    },
  ]
*/
```

The `findAuthorById()` function in `public/src/books.js` has two parameters, in the following order:

- An array of authors.
- An ID of a single author.

It returns the author object that has the matching ID.

**Example:**

```javascript
findAuthorById(authors, 11);
/*

    id: 11,
    name: {
      first: "Luz",
      last: "Beach",
    },
  }
*/
```

#### findBookById()

The `findBookById()` function in `public/src/books.js` has two parameters, in the following order:

    title: "est voluptate nisi",
    ...
  }
*/
```

#### partitionBooksByBorrowedStatus()

The `partitionBooksByBorrowedStatus()` function in `public/src/books.js` has a single parameter:

- An array of books.

It returns an array with two arrays inside of it. All of the inputted books are present in either the first or second array.

The first array contains books _that have been loaned out, and are not yet returned_ while the second array contains books _that have been returned._ You can check for the return status by looking at the first transaction in the `borrows` array.

**Example:**

```javascript
partitionBooksByBorrowedStatus(books);
/*
  [
    [
      {
        id: "5f447132d487bd81da01e25e",
        title: "sit eiusmod occaecat eu magna",
        genre: "Science",
        authorId: 8,
        borrows: [
          {
            id: "5f446f2e2cfa3e1d234679b9",
            returned: false,
          },
          ...
        ]
      },
      ...
    ],
    [
      {
        id: "5f44713265e5d8d17789beb0",
        title: "tempor occaecat fugiat",
        genre: "Travel",
        authorId: 16,
        borrows: [
          {
            id: "5f446f2e4eff1030e7316861",
            returned: true,
          },
          ...
        ]
      },
      ...
    ]
  ]
*/
```

#### getBorrowersForBook()

The `getBorrowersForBook()` function in `public/src/books.js` has two parameters, in the following order:

- A book object.
- An array of all accounts.

It should return an array of all the transactions from the book's `borrows` key. However, each transaction should include the related account information and the `returned` key.

**Example:**

```javascript
getBorrowersForBook(book, accounts);
/*
  [
    {
      id: "5f446f2e4eff1030e7316861",

    },
  ]
*/
```

## Home functions

### getTotalBooksCount()

The `getTotalBooksCount()` function in `public/src/home.js` has a single parameter:

- An array of books.

It returns a number that represents the number of book objects inside of the array.

**Example:**

```javascript
getTotalBooksCount(books); // 100
```

### getTotalAccountsCount()

The `getTotalAccountsCount()` function in `public/src/home.js` has a single parameter:

- An array of accounts.

It returns a number that represents the number of account objects inside of the array.

**Example:**

```javascript
getTotalAccountsCount(accounts); // 75
```

### getBooksBorrowedCount()

The `getBooksBorrowedCount()` function in `public/src/home.js` has a single parameter:

- An array of books.

It returns a number that represents the number of books _that are currently checked out of the library._ This number can be found by looking at the first transaction in the `borrows` key of each book. If the transaction says the book has not been returned (i.e. `returned: false`), the book has been borrowed.

**Example:**

```javascript
getBooksBorrowedCount(accounts); // 65
```

### getMostCommonGenres()

The `getMostCommonGenres()` function in `public/src/home.js` has a single parameter:

- An array of books.

It returns an array containing five objects or fewer that represents the most common occurring genres, ordered from most common to least.

Each object in the returned array has two keys:

- The `name` key which represents the name of the genre.
- The `count` key which represents the number of times the genre occurs.

If more than five genres are present, only the top five should be returned.

**Example:**

```javascript
getMostCommonGenres(books);
/*
  [
    { name: "Nonfiction", count: 9 },
    { name: "Historical Fiction", count: 7 },
    { name: "Thriller", count: 7 },
    ...
  ]
*/
```

### getMostPopularBooks()

The `getMostPopularBooks()` function in `public/src/home.js` has a single parameter:

- An array of books.

It returns an array containing five objects or fewer that represents the most popular books in the library. Popularity is represented by the number of times a book has been borrowed.

Each object in the returned array has two keys:

- The `name` key which represents the title of the book.
- The `count` key which represents the number of times the book has been borrowed.

If more than five books are present, only the top five should be returned.

**Example:**

```javascript
getMostPopularBooks(books);
/*
  [
    { name: "incididunt nostrud minim", count: 30 },
    { name: "culpa do sint", count: 30 },
    { name: "ullamco est minim", count: 29 },
    ...
  ]
*/
```

### getMostPopularAuthors()

The `getMostPopularAuthors()` function in `public/src/home.js` has two parameters, in the following order:

- An array of books.
- An array of authors.

It returns an array containing five objects or fewer that represents the most popular authors whose books have been checked out the most. Popularity is represented by finding all of the books written by the author and then adding up the number of times those books have been borrowed.

Each object in the returned array has two keys:

- The `name` key which represents the first and last name of the author.
- The `count` key which represents the number of times the author's books have been borrowed.

If more than five authors are present, only the top five should be returned.

**Example:**

```javascript
getMostPopularAuthors(books, authors);
/*
  [
    { name: "Cristina Buchanan", count: 112 },
    { name: "Tami Hurst", count: 83 },
    { name: "Chrystal Lester", count: 80 },
    ...
  ]
*/
```
